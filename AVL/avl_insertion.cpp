/* In this program we'll be implementing AVL insertion and deletion */

/* Intro: AVL is nothing but a self balancing binary search tree
   * can also be called as perfect binary search tree
   * Makes searchig much faster than the regular BST
   * search operation depends on the height of the bi
   * nary search tree so in avl tree balancing factor
   * takes care of the height to minimum which results
   * in the search operation of the order (log(n)) */
